				<p class="script">
					Istanbul is in north-western Turkey within the Marmara Region on a total area of 5,343 square kilometers (2,063 sq mi).
					The Bosphorus, which connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, divides the city into a European,
					Thracian side—comprising the historic and economic centers—and an Asian, Anatolian side. The city is further divided by the Golden Horn,
					a natural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former Byzantium and Constantinople were founded.
					The confluence of the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus,
					and the Golden Horn at the heart of present-day Istanbul has deterred attacking forces for thousands of years
					and remains a prominent feature of the city's landscape.
					<br><br>
					<p class="script">
					Following the model of Rome, the historic peninsula is said to be characterized by seven hills, each topped by imperial mosques.
					The easternmost of these hills is the site of Topkapı Palace on the Sarayburnu.
					Rising from the opposite side of the Golden Horn is another, conical hill, where the modern Beyoğlu district is.
					Because of the topography, buildings in Beyoğlu were once constructed with the help of terraced retaining walls,
					and roads were laid out in the form of steps.Üsküdar on the Asian side exhibits similarly hilly characteristics,
					with the terrain gradually extending down to the Bosphorus coast, but the landscape in Şemsipaşa and Ayazma is more abrupt,
					akin to a promontory. The highest point in Istanbul is Çamlıca Hill, with an altitude of 288 meters (945 ft).
					The northern half of Istanbul has a higher mean elevation compared to the south coast, with locations surpassing 200 meters (660 ft),
					and some coasts with steep cliffs resembling fjords, especially around the northern end of the Bosphorus,
					where it opens up to the Black Sea.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="script">
					In the Köppen–Geiger classification system, Istanbul has a borderline Mediterranean climate (Csa),
					humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and oceanic climate (Cfb), due to its location in a transitional climatic zone.
					Since precipitation in summer months ranges from 20 to 65 mm (1 to 3 in), depending on location,
					the city cannot be classified as solely Mediterranean or humid subtropical.Due to its size, diverse topography,
					maritime location and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of water to the north and south,
					Istanbul exhibits microclimates. The northern half of the city, as well as the Bosporus coastline,
					express characteristics of oceanic and humid subtropical climates,
					because of humidity from the Black Sea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation.
					The climate in the populated areas of the city to the south, on the Sea of Marmara, is warmer, drier and less affected by humidity.
					The annual precipitation in the northern half can be twice as much (Bahçeköy, 1166.6 mm), than it is in the southern,
					Marmara coast (Florya 635.0 mm).
					There is a significant difference between annual mean temperatures on the north and south coasts as well,
					Bahçeköy 12.8 °C (55.0 °F), Kartal 15.03 °C (59.05 °F).
					Parts of the province that are away from both seas exhibit considerable continental influences,
					with much more pronounced night-day and summer-winter temperature differences.
					In winter some parts of the province average freezing or below at night.

					the hotel is a two-minute walk from the city's main thoroughfare, Istikal Caddesi.<br><br>

				<p>

					In a hipster neighborhood,<br> the W Istanbul occupies one of the attractive Akaretler Row Houses,<br>
					which were built in a distinctly Western style in the 1870s.<br>

					and downing cocktails before dinner at one of the many area restaurants.<br>
					A short taxi ride (depending on the unpredictable traffic) from Istanbul's major sites,<br>
					the W Istanbul is the focal point of a quiet and very European neighborhood.<br><br>

					many with views over the Bosphorus.<br><br>
