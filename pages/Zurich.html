				<p class="script">
					 Zürich is situated at 408 m (1,339 ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Zürich (Zürichsee)
					 about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side.
					 The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat, which flows from the lake,
					 running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west.
					 The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat,
					 about 700 m (2,300 ft) north of where the river issues from Lake Zürich.
					 Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills
					 and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley (Glattal) and to the north in the Limmat Valley (Limmattal).
					 The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal.
					 This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.
					<br><br>
					<p class="script">
					Zürich has, depending on the definition used, an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb),
					but in the higher areas it is defined as a humid continental climate (Dfb, using 0°C isoterm)
					with warm summers and four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Zürich are both the winds from westerly directions,
					which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind),
					which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average.
					The Foehn wind, which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Zürich.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="script">
						The annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Zürich-Fluntern
						(556 m[1,824 ft] above sea level on the slope of the Zürichberg, 150 m[490 ft] above the level of the city centre) is
						9.3 °C (48.7 °F). The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with −2.0 °C (28.4 °F)
						and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with 24.0 °C (75.2 °F).
						On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) (so-called frost days),
						and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) (so-called ice days).
						There are on average of 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above 25 °C [77 °F]) throughout the year,
						while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above 30 °C [86 °F]) are 5.8 days.

						The average high temperature in July is 24.0 °C (75.2 °F) and average low temperature is 14 °C (57.2 °F).
						The highest recorded temperature in Zürich was 37.7 °C (100 °F), recorded on July 1947,
						and typically the warmest day reaches an average of 32.2 °C (90.0 °F).
