				<h1>5 of the best hotels in Paris</h1>
				<br><br>
				<p>
					(WORLD TELESCOPE) — In Paris, you're never stuck for something to do, see, eat or drink--
					no matter what time of the night or day it is.<br>But even the most energetic travelers need somewhere to take a breather.<br>
					In a destination packed with more hotels than you could visit in a lifetime, finding the best isn't easy.<br>
					But these five are among the best the city has to offer when you stay here:
				</p>
				<br><br>

					<h2>1. Motel One Paris-Porte Dorée </h2>
					<img src="../Pictures/hot11.jpg" title="Motel One Paris-Porte Dorée">

				<br><br>
				<p>

					Located in the 12th district of Paris, <br>
					Motel One Paris-Porte Dorée provides a garden and an on-site bar.<br>
					1. There was more space that I expected - enough for yoga and foamrolling. <br>
					This is really a surprising luxury for rooms in Paris <br>
					2. Giant bed with many pillows <br>
					3. The rooms and the rest of the hotel is perfectly clean, <br>
					spacious, new and beautifully designed. <br>
					Very cosy 4. Loved the shower and the eco-friendly soap <br>
					5. The staff is friendly and professional<br>
					6. The breakfast is wow. Everything I tasted was great.<br>
					I get up late, so I was sad that the organic eggs were finished<br>
					a couple of times (keep in mind) <br>
					7. The hotel is super quiet, which is very important to me. <br>
					Absolute silence at night 8. I was worried about the location,<br>
					but it is really not a problem. There is a subway, tram and buses. <br>
					Also I found the area one of the most beautiful and worthy of visit in Paris, <br>
					with a beautiful park, lake, botanical and zoological gardens,<br>
					amazing Chateau de Vincennes... There was no line to enter. <br>
					I could walk the castle and be alone there. <br>
					It is a very different experience from sharing the walk <br>
					with a dozen or more of people <br>
					(this is what usually happens in popular places in Paris). <br>
					There is a museum, cafes and restaurants next to the hotel. <br>
					It is a quiet area, almost devoid of tourists and noise - I loved it 9. <br>
					I didn’t have the chance to chill in the lounge, <br>
					but I saw people enjoying it and the bar. <br>
					Looked very appealing I recommend it to people<br>
					who are less into tasting the discomforts of Paris rooms <br>
					and enjoying the noise while sleeping. <br>
					It is a great hotel to get away, rest and then go back, <br>
					or enjoy less crowded area of Paris. <br>
					Loved it and would love to stay there again. .<br>
