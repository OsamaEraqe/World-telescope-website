		 Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, by 1822,
		 a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.[31]

	In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai.
	The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836,
	leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty.</p><br>
    <p  class="script">
	Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against
	Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual
	Maritime Truce. Dubai also – like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom
	took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892.
     	In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke
		out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti - palm fronds.
		The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed.
		The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.
		In 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave
		merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. </p><br>
		<p  class="script">
		These policies saw a movement of merchants not only
		directly from Lingeh, but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through
		the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer
		of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels
		made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo. The
		frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the
		transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief
		entrepôt of the Trucial States.

		The 'great storm' of 1908 struck  towards the end of the pearling
		season that year.

		  <h1 class="heading">5 of the best hotels in Dubai</h1>
	      	 <p >(WORLD TELESCOPE) — In Dubai, you're never stuck for something to do, see, eat or drink--<br> no matter what time of the night or day it is.
			But even the most energetic travelers need somewhere to take a breather.<br>
			In a destination packed with more hotels than you could visit in a lifetime,<br> finding the best isn't easy.
			But these five are among the best the city has to offer when you stay here:</p>

		    <h3 class="hotelname"> 1.Jumeirah hotel</h3><br><br>
			<img src="../Pictures/Dubai1.jpg" title="Jumeirah hotel" style="margin-top:25px;" width="600px;"><br>
			<p>With five pretty pools and more than a mile of sandy shoreline,<br>
                this fashionable Arabian Gulf <br>
			resort within a resort caters to beach lovers<br>
                and offers access to all the facilities<br>
                within the Madinat Jumeirah complex, <br>
			including a spa, fitness centre, tennis courts, water park <br>
                and waterways serviced by abra boat taxis. </p><br>

			<p>Bastion of modern luxury, champion of local heritage <br>
                Taj Dubai wears both caps comfortably.<br>
			An antidote to the region's obsession with beige, <br>
                the hotel is a carnival of colour and its varied <br>
			restaurants are full of personality and happy customers.
                It may be in the business district, <br>
                but here it's all about pleasure.  </p><br>
			<div class="price">
			  <span>From $81 per night</span>
			  <a href="Tickets.html" class="book"> Book here</a>

			<p>Al Maha was the UAE’s first desert escape <br>
                and while there are now a handful of <br>
                heavenly retreats set amidst the dunes,<br>
			this romantic eco-friendly resort still remains its most seductive. <br>
                It is best suited to honeymooners or those looking for alone time,<br>
			along with very close friends.  </p><br>
