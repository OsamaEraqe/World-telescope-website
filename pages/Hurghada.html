		 The city was founded in the early 20th century, and until recently it was a small fishing village. But since the 1980s,
		 it has been continually enlarged by Egyptian and foreign investors to become the leading coastal resort on the Red Sea. Holiday resorts
		 and hotels provide aquatic sport facilities for windsurfers, kitesurfers, yachtsmen, scuba divers and snorkelers. Hurghada is known for
		 its watersports activities, nightlife and warm weather. Daily temperature hovers round 30 °C (86 °F) most of the year, during July and August
		 temperatures reach over 40 °C (104 °F). Many Europeans head to Hurghada for their regular Holidays, especially during the Winter season and spend
		 their Christmas and New Year holidays in the city. Tourism from Russia dropped drastically after the Metrojet Flight 9268 plane crash in
		 November 2015.</p><br>
         <p  class="script">
		Hurghada stretches for about 36 kilometres (22 mi) along the seashore, and it does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is
		a destination for Egyptian tourists from Cairo, the Delta and Upper Egypt, as well as package holiday tourists from Europe. Today Hurghada counts
		248,000 inhabitants

		The village, which later evolved into what is now the city of Hurghada, was settled in 1905. It acquired its name from a plant which has
		grown naturally since ancient times. By then it was only a fishing village. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913, but actual production
		and export only began in 1921 under British oil magnates. During the reign of King Farouk a recreational center was built in the city, but
		after President Nasser's nationalization of Egypt's industries it was turned over to the armed forces.</p><br>
         <p  class="script">
		During the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt, Shadwan island east of the city in the Red Sea, was fortified and held by
		Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22 January 1970, it was the site of Operation Rhodes, a heliborne assault by Israeli
		troops which occupied the island for 36 hours.

		During the October War of 1973, Hurghada harbor was target for four Israeli operations [he]. Israeli forces also[when?]occupied
		Shadwan Island with over 32 casualties to the Egyptian army, and only 7 to the Israeli army .[citation needed]

		On September 27, 1994 drive-by shooters killed two Egyptians and a German tourist; another German man was wounded in the attack
		and died of his injuries after returning to Germany. The 2016 Hurghada attack was caused by two terrorists inspired by IS. Three
		tourists were wounded. On 14 July 2017, in the 2017 Hurghada attack a man proclaiming, that he wanted to kill only non-Egyptians,
		attacked and stabbed five German, one Czech and one Armenian tourists, all women, killing two German women. The Czech tourist later died
		on July 27 in the hospital. The attack occurred at two separate resort hotels.
