		 Mykonos came under the control of the Romans during the reign of the Roman Empire and then became part of the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century.
 		 In 1204, with the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, Mykonos was occupied by Andrea Ghisi, a relative of the Doge of Venice. The island was
		 ravaged by the Catalans at the end of the 13th century and finally given over to direct Venetian rule in 1390.

		In 1537, while the Venetians still reigned, Mykonos was attacked by Hayreddin Barbarossa, the admiral of Suleiman the Magnificent and an Ottoman fleet
		established itself on the island. The Ottomans, under the leadership of Kapudan Pasha, imposed a system of self-governance comprising a governor and
		an appointed council of syndics. When the castle of Tinos fell to the Ottomans in 1718, the last of the Venetians withdrew from the region.</p><br>
        <p  class="script">
		Up until the end of the 18th century, Mykonos prospered as a trading centre, attracting many immigrants from nearby islands,
		in addition to regular pirate raids. In June 1794 the Battle of Mykonos was fought between British and French ships in the island's main harbour.

		The Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire broke out in 1821 and Mykonos played an important role, led by the national heroine,
		Manto Mavrogenous. Mavrogenous, a well-educated aristocrat guided by the ideas of the Enlightenment, sacrificed her family's fortune
		for the Greek cause. Greece became an independent state in 1830. A statue of her sits in the middle of Mando Mavrogenous square in the main town.</p><br>
        <p  class="script">
		As a result of sailing and merchant activity, the island's economy quickly picked up but declined again during the late 19th century and especially
		after the opening of the Corinth Canal in 1904 and the First World War at the beginning of the 20th century. Many Mykonians left the island to find
		work in mainland Greece and many foreign countries, especially the United States.

		In Greek mythology, Mykonos was named after its first ruler, Mykonos (Μύκονος), the son or grandson of the god Apollo and a local hero.
		The island is also said to have been the location of a great battle between Zeus and Titans and where Hercules killed the invincible giants
		having lured them from the protection of Mount Olympus. According to myth, the large rocks all over the island are said to be the petrified
		testicles (or, in bowdlerized versions, the entire corpses) of the giants.
		Tourism soon came to dominate the local economy, owing a lot to the important excavations carried out by the French School of Archaeology,
		which began work in Delos in 1873.
