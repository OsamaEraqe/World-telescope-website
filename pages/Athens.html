				<p class="script">
					Athens is a global city and one of the biggest economic centres in southeastern Europe.
					It has a large financial sector, and its port Piraeus is both the largest passenger port in Europe,
				    and the second largest in the world.[15] while at the same time being the sixth busiest passenger port in Europe.
					The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), which actually constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire city,
					had a population of 664,046 (in 2011) within its official limits, and a land area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi).
					The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits,
					with a population of 3,090,508 (in 2011) over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi).
					According to Eurostat in 2011, the functional urban area (FUA) of Athens
					was the 9th most populous FUA in the European Union (the 6th most populous capital city of the EU),
					with a population of 3.8 million people. Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.
					<br><br>
					<p class="script">
					Athens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity.
					Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved,
					in part because of its successful bid to stage the 2004 Olympic Games.
					The Greek Government, aided by the EU,
					has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport,
					the expansion of the Athens Metro system, and the new Attiki Odos Motorway.
					Athens was voted as the third best European city to visit in 2015 by European Best Destination.
					More than 240,000 people voted.

					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="script">
						The heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art,
						the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization.
						The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.
						Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery.
						Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834,
						include the Hellenic Parliament and the so-called "architectural trilogy of Athens", consisting of the National Library of Greece,
						the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Academy of Athens.
						Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the National Archeological Museum,
						featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the Acropolis Museum, the Museum of Cycladic Art,
						the Benaki Museum and the Byzantine and Christian Museum. Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896,
						and 108 years later it welcomed home the 2004 Summer Olympics,
						making it one of only a handful of cities to have hosted the Olympics more than once.
